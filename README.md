# Machine Learning Tutorials for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

This is a series of machine learning tutorials I'm writing for implementing deep learning models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library. Basic knowledge of PyTorch and neural networks is assumed. These tutorials are composed of two sections: 

ðŸ”´ This tutorial was primarily conducted in **Korean** as the main language. References were left untranslated in English. Unfortunately, I will not upload the custom package required to run the tutorial. The contents of the custom package are or will be implemented in the tutorial. Therefore, I want the user to implement the part yourself.

ðŸ”´ It was written in **Korean**, but the README is English because you need to have this level of English reading skills to understand tutorials.


## Papers
This section is based on research papers. It is designed to enable coding while reading the paper, and executed it in a Colab for both coding and running small tasks. This write-up serves as a review, blending personal thoughts on the paper with key insights.

ðŸ”´ If the file is large or difficult to run in Colab, it can be uploaded as `.py`.
